# Getting Started
Just playing around and learning a bit of F# :)

# My Setup
- open up the command line (cmd) as Administrator then....
- Install chocolatey: https://chocolatey.org (follow instructions on site), then use it to install the following
- choco install visualfsharptools
- set PATH=%PATH%;C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft SDKs\F#\3.1\Framework\v4.0
- choco install atom
- choco install git
- git remote add origin https://github.com/jbaum25/LearningFSharp.git
- git push -u origin master

Atom (installed above) is my text editor that I am using.

After installing Atom, go to the main menu and click on File then Settings.  Then search for "fsharp" and install the fsharp tools package. Then You are all set just like me!
